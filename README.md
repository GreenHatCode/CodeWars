# CodeWars
This repository is dedicated to my solutions to various katas from www.codewars.com. Since I am a programming student, I always try to solve algorithmic problems to get practical experience and test my knowledge, as well as to discuss my solutions with other people. 

In this repository, you will find 2 types of solutions: a simple .cpp file and a folder. 

The .cpp file represents a simple kata which in my opinion needs no explanation, such files only contain a link to the kata page at the top. The folder represents complex, popular or very interesting kata that I want to explain how I solved them or provide several solutions (sometimes both), the link to the source of the kata is in README.md with the explanation of the solution.
